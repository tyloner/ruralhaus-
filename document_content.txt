ANNEX IV - Sustainability 
Sustainability Certifications
To ensure and demonstrate compliance with high environmental standards, the fund will seek to obtain relevant sustainability certifications for its properties. These certifications serve as benchmarks for sustainability and are recognized globally for promoting best practices in environmental, community, and economic impact.
 Some key certifications we will target include:
LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design): One of the most popular green building certification programs worldwide, LEED certification ensures that the design, construction, operations, and maintenance of a property are environmentally responsible and use resources efficiently.
B Corp: Leading certification for companies that aim to create a positive impact on society, employees, the community, and the environment, while still being profitable. 
Strategies for Achieving Certifications
Eco-Friendly Materials and Technologies: Utilizing sustainable building materials and technologies that reduce carbon emissions and energy use. This includes high-efficiency HVAC systems, solar panels, and thermally efficient exterior materials.
Water Conservation: Implementing systems for rainwater harvesting and gray water recycling to reduce water usage. Low-flow fixtures and drought-resistant landscaping will also be standards.
Waste Reduction: During construction and renovations, the fund will prioritize waste reduction strategies. This includes recycling materials and minimizing construction waste through precise ordering and usage of materials.

Decision making and reporting: 

In a real estate private fund, decisions are made at different levels depending on the type and scope of the decision:
Strategic Decisions: Major decisions such as new market entry, significant property acquisitions, and overall fund strategy are made by the Board of Directors (or General Partner), typically through a voting process.
Simple Majority (51%): Used for routine decisions like approving financial reports or minor property investments.
Supermajority (66% or 75%): Required for major strategic moves, such as large acquisitions, changes in fund structure, or distribution of returns.
Unanimous Consent: Needed for exceptional decisions, such as fund liquidation or changes to investment agreements.
Operational Decisions: Day-to-day management decisions, such as property management, project execution, and routine expenses, are handled by the Management Team. The team also executes decisions approved by the board or relevant committees.
Delegated Authority: The management team may have predefined authority to approve smaller operational expenses or project costs without board approval, speeding up decision-making.
Project-Specific Decisions: The Projects Direction Committee focuses on approving and guiding individual projects, including acquisitions, development, and exits. The committee uses a structured review process to ensure projects align with the overall fund strategy and financial objectives.
2. Committees
Several specialized committees can help streamline decision-making and focus on specific areas of fund management:
Board of Directors: Responsible for overall governance, strategic oversight, and approving major decisions that impact the entire fund.
Investment Committee: Reviews and approves capital allocation for property acquisitions and sales. It ensures investment decisions align with the portfolio strategy and financial objectives.
Projects Direction Committee:
Oversees and provides strategic direction for individual real estate projects.

1. Decision Making
Decision-making will be structured at various levels depending on the type and scale of the decision:
Strategic Decisions: Major decisions, such as entering new markets, significant property acquisitions, and determining overall fund strategy, will be made by the General Partners through a structured voting process.
Simple Majority (51%): We will use this for routine decisions, such as approving financial reports or small property investments.
Supermajority (66% or 75%): This will be required for major strategic moves, such as large acquisitions, changes in fund structure, or distributions to investors.
Unanimous Consent: This will be needed for extraordinary decisions, such as fund liquidation or amendments to investment agreements.
Operational Decisions: The Management Team will handle day-to-day decisions, such as property management, project execution, and routine expenses. Additionally, they will execute decisions approved by the board or relevant committees.
Delegated Authority: We will grant the management team predefined authority to approve smaller operational expenses or project costs without board approval, streamlining decision-making.
Project-Specific Decisions: The Projects Direction Committee will focus on approving and guiding individual projects, such as acquisitions, developments, and exits. This committee will use a structured review process to ensure that projects align with the fund's overall strategy and financial goals.
2. Committees
We will implement several specialized committees to ensure focused decision-making across various areas:
Board of Directors: This board will be responsible for overall governance, providing strategic oversight, and approving major decisions that impact the entire fund.
Investment Committee: The Investment Committee will review and approve capital allocations for property acquisitions and sales, ensuring that investment decisions align with the portfolio strategy and financial objectives.
Projects Direction Committee:
This committee will oversee and provide strategic guidance for individual real estate projects.
They will approve project proposals, monitor progress, and evaluate key milestones to ensure each project aligns with the fund's overall objectives.
3. Conflict Resolution
We will establish clear conflict resolution mechanisms to ensure smooth decision-making and maintain trust between stakeholders:
Recusal Process: In cases where there is a potential conflict of interest, the affected member ( committee member, or manager) will be required to recuse themselves from the decision-making process.
Escalation Procedures: For decisions that lead to a deadlock, we will implement an escalation process whereby unresolved issues are elevated to higher authorities, such as the General Partner or an external arbitrator.
Third-Party Mediation: For complex disputes, particularly those involving investors or external stakeholders, we will engage a neutral third-party mediator to provide resolution.
4. Reporting
To ensure transparency and maintain investor confidence, we will implement structured reporting processes at various levels:
Board Reporting: The management team will provide regular reports to the Board of Directors, detailing key operational updates, financial performance, and major projects in progress.
Committee Reporting: Each committee, including the Investment and Projects Direction Committees, will prepare reports outlining the decisions made, progress updates, and any challenges or risks identified.
Investor Reporting: Investors will receive quarterly and annual reports, which will include financial statements, updates on project performance, and any significant strategic shifts. Additionally, we will hold annual general meetings (AGMs) to discuss key fund activities, strategy, and performance.
Real-Time Updates: For large or high-impact projects, we will provide more frequent updates to investors and board members, ensuring they are informed of key milestones or any critical changes in project status.
This structured approach will enable effective governance, informed decision-making, and transparent communication across all levels of the fund’s operations.
